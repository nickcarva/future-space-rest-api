In here, you can see and test the REST API of rocket launches from FutureSpace Inc.


## üöÄ Getting started

To clone and run the application, you will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (with a pre created database named future-space) installed on your machine. With all programs installed, run the following command lines:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/nickcarva/future-space-rest-api.git

# Access the repository
$ cd future-space-rest-api

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run all migrations
$ yarn typeorm migration:run
```

Before start the server, you must copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and fill the environment variables based your data to access the pg database and the API.

```bash
# Run application
$ yarn dev
```


## üîë API Key

So that you can access all the REST API endpoints, you must put an API key authorization header in the request. This API Key is registered in the `.env` file (just for a representation of security).
<br>
The header key is 'api-key'.

## üìç REST API

`GET /`: Return the message "REST Back-end Challenge 20201209 Running"

`PUT /launchers/:launch_id`: Update a launch data

`DELETE /launchers/:launch_id`: Delete a launch

`GET /launchers/:launch_id`: Show a launch data

`GET /launchers`: List all launches


## ‚è± Launches imports schedule

So that we can have all launches updated, a schedule is set to everyday at 6:30 AM +00 for import all launches from the Space Devs API. When testing this project, you can change the schedule time in `src/schedules/LaunchesImporterSchedule.ts` using the [node-schedule CRON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) rules.
